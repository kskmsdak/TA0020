Build a full-stack web application using Python (Flask), SQLite, Tailwind CDN (no complex frontend framework). Keep the UI simple, clean, and realistic — it should look like it was built in 2–3 hours for a hackathon. No heavy animations, no complex UI libraries.

Project Name: Blockchain-Based Citizen Auditor AI (Local Civic Version)

Core Concept

A transparency platform connecting Citizens, Contractors, and Admin (Government). It uses:

AI for report structuring and summarization

A demo blockchain (hash chaining) for report immutability

Role-based dashboards

Public transparency ledger

Tech Stack

Backend: Flask

Database: SQLite

Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CDN

Charts: Chart.js (basic usage)

Hashing: SHA256

Password storage: hashed

AI: Use OpenAI API or mock AI functions

Roles
1️⃣ Citizen

Login with email & password.

Home page:

“Create / Write Report” button

Track report status:

Report Sent

Received

Admin Verified

Budget Allocated

Contractor Selected

Work Started

Work Completed

Feedback Submitted

Create Report Page:

Option 1: Manual form

Option 2: AI-assisted
AI asks:

Area/Ward

Complaint Type (broken road, garbage, water leakage, street light etc.)

Description

Estimated impact

Optional fund misuse estimate
AI generates structured civic audit report.

After submission:

Report stored in DB

New block added to blockchain

Severity score calculated using keyword-weight logic.

After work completion:
Citizen must submit rating before creating next report.

2️⃣ Contractor

Login with email & password.

Dashboard shows:

“Civic Contract Marketplace” (list of published government contracts)
Each contract shows:

Project title

Location

Budget

Duration

Required skills

Apply button

If selected:

Can update status:

Start Work

Complete Work

3️⃣ Admin

Login with email & password.
Admin account auto-generated password (stored hashed).

Dashboard:

All reports table

Sort by:

New

Old

Importance

AI summary column

Severity score column

Assign contractor

Allocate budget

Change report stage

Monthly analytics (Chart.js)

Yearly analytics

Blockchain (Demo)

Each report stored as block:
{
id,
timestamp,
report_data,
severity_score,
previous_hash,
current_hash
}

Hash = SHA256(all fields + previous_hash)

Add “Verify Blockchain Integrity” button.

If any record altered, verification fails.

Ledger Page (Public Transparency)

Accessible to everyone.
Shows:

All ongoing projects

Allocated budget

Progress %

Time remaining

Current status

Contractor assigned

Rating System

After contractor marks work completed:
Citizen must rate (1–5 stars + feedback)
Contractor rating stored.

Importance Scoring

Use keyword weighted scoring:
High:

collapse

danger

sewage overflow

contamination

Medium:

broken

leakage

garbage

Low:

delay

slow

Score = keyword_weight + urgency_weight + impact_weight + fund_weight

Demo Accounts

Create preloaded accounts:

Citizen:
email: citizen@test.com

password: 1234

Contractor:
email: contractor@test.com

password: 1234

Admin:
email: admin@test.com

password: auto-generated

Keep UI minimal:

White background

Simple navbar

Card layout

Basic tables

No animations

Clean but simple

Generate full folder structure and working app.
