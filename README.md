🚀 Blockchain-Based Citizen-Auditor System

Bringing transparency, accountability, and trust to government-funded projects.

🔥 The Problem

Government development funds often lack transparency.

Citizens cannot:

Track where funds are being spent

Verify project progress

Detect manipulation in reported data

This creates corruption, delays, and public distrust.

💡 Our Solution

The Citizen Auditor System is a blockchain-powered platform that ensures:

Transparent fund tracking

Tamper-proof transaction records

Role-based accountability

Real-time monitoring of development projects

By storing critical records on blockchain, data becomes immutable and auditable.
